This code refers to the Gradient Maximum Likelihood Algorithm from the Paluch paper:
"Fast and accurate detection of spread source in large complex networks"

The big idea is that they assume a SI model and that propagation times are normally 
distributed with known mu and sigma.

Shah & Zaman use a BFS method and assign rumor centrality as a means of picking the 
source.
PTVA relaxes the assumptions of Shah & Zaman by using a set of observers and not every node.

GMLaA further relaxes assumptions and reduces computational complexity through
subsetting the set of randomly chosen observers to k0. 

GMLA is sensitive to number k0 chosen so that is a parameter that can be tuned.
They actually study the number k0 versus precision and assert that:
k0 = 0.5 *sqrt(N) where N is the number of nodes in the network.
"Enhancing MLE 2021" paper follow-up to their previous paper.


Some tasks to prepare for the algorithm:
-obtain a network of nodes and edges
-simulate SI model on the network they use infection rate Beta = 0.5 (prop ratio lambda = sqrt(2))
-prop ratio uses known mu and sigma: lambda = mu/sig
-randomly select observers K in network (they use density rho =0.2)
-sort observers by observed delays after prop ratio assigned
-leave k0 observers after sort
-select one observer as reference
-compute vector of observed relative delays
-initialize suspected source vector S
-initialize vector v (first observer with initial score =0)
-initialize max score = 0 at start
-enter while loop
-take observer one from sorted list and look at its neighbors
-form a diffusion tree via BFS from neighbor n to the other k0
-compute mu vector which takes in length of shortest path to the k0
-compute capt. lambda matrix 
-compute score
-pick neighbor with highest score
-look at its neighbors. do the same thing


Recall The waiting time for a transmission across a particular edge is modeled by an exponential random variable with mean
1/Î². Where we set B = 0.5 . The authors assume that the probability of infection is basically a coin flip.

lambda = mu/sd = 1/sqrt(1-beta).

They use lambda=sqrt(2) or beta=0.5.

First we need to simulate this propagation. Fortunately, Jake Fisher with Duke ran through this

```{r}
library(statnet)

##### Example 1: Disease epidemics ####
# The most straightforward and common use for a diffusion simulation is to
# simulate an epidemic spreading through a population.  Some examples of this
# include:
# Moody, James. 2002. "The Importance of Relationship Timing for Diffusion." 
#      Social Forces 81(1):25-56.
# Merli, M.Giovanna, James Moody, Joshua Mendelsohn, and Robin Gauthier. 2015.
#      "Sexual Mixing in Shanghai: Are Heterosexual Contact Patterns Compatible 
#      With an HIV/AIDS Epidemic?" Demography 52(3):919-42.

# In the example here, we will simulate an epidemic spreading through a random
# network.  This roughly approximates a "random mixing" scenario, where people
# interact randomly.

# To simulate random mixing, we construct the following rules:
# 1. Set up a world with a fixed number of people and a small fraction of 
#    initial infections, arranged randomly as a network
# 2. Pick an edge at random
# 3. If the edge is discordant (a susceptible-infected connection), flip a coin
#    to determine whether the non-infected person gets infected
# 4. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until everyone is infected, or until a certain number
#    of steps has passed

# First, in our simple example, let's set our parameters ahead of time
n.people <- 100
N=100
p.infection <- 0.5
pct.starting.infected <- 0.01
max.time <- 5000
contact.rate <- 0.05 / 2  # prob. of contact between any 2 people in the network

### Step 1: Set up world ###
# Create a random graph, where edges are placed randomly.  This is called a
# Bernoulli or an Erdos-Renyi random graph
set.seed(919)
net <- rgraph(n = n.people, tprob = contact.rate) %>%
  symmetrize %>%  # Make symmetric -- doesn't matter who is connected to who
  network(matrix.type = "adjacency")  # convert to statnet
library(shp2graph)

# Chose a subset of people who are infected initially
infected <- sample(
  x = c(T, F),      # people can be infected (T) or susceptible (F)
  size = n.people,  # create a vector that is n.people long
  replace = T,      # with replacement, so that >1 person can be infected
  prob = c(pct.starting.infected, 1 - pct.starting.infected)
  )

infected

#looks like node 69 is true source



### Step 2: Choose an edge ###
# For each step, we're going to choose an edge at random, and then, if the edge
# is discordant, flip a coin to determine whether the susceptible person gets
# infected.

# First, create an edgelist...
el <- as.edgelist(net) %>%
  as.data.frame %>%
  set_names(value = c("from", "to")) %>%
  
  # ... attach the values of infected...
  mutate(from.infected = infected[from], to.infected = infected[to],
         
         # ... and create a discordant variable
         discordant = (from.infected != to.infected))

# Next, choose an edge at random
random.edge <- sample(nrow(el), size = 1)

# Check if the edge is discordant
el[random.edge, "discordant"]  # it's not, so we do nothing.

# For the example, I'm going to speed this up by choosing a discordant edge
discordant.edge <- sample(which(el$discordant), size = 1)

### Step 3: Flip a coin to see if the person gets infected ###

# Now, flip a coin to see if the uninfected person gets infected
el[discordant.edge, ]  # Person 62 is the suceptible, but we will want to be
                       # able to determine that without looking manually

# A little tricky indexing to pull out the ID of the susceptible person...
who.susceptible <- with(
  el[discordant.edge, ],
  c(from, to)[!c(from.infected, to.infected)]
  )

# Flip the coin to determine if infection spreads (it does)
(infected[who.susceptible] <- sample(c(T, F), size = 1, 
                                    prob = c(p.infection, 1 - p.infection)))

### Step 4: Repeat ###
# To repeat this process, we actually embed steps 1 and 2 in a loop.

# Set up a list with the output
infections <- vector(length = max.time, mode = "list")

# Save what we already did as the first iteration
infections[[1]] <- infected

# Quick aside -- what did we create?
head(infections)

# Drop the "from.infected", "to.infected", and "discordant" columns from el,
# because they'll actually change with every iteration
el %<>% select(-from.infected, -to.infected, -discordant)

# Next, run the loop

for (t in 2:max.time) {
  infections[[t]] <- infections[[t - 1]]
  
  # Pick an edge at random
  random.edge <- sample(nrow(el), size = 1)
  
  # If the edge is discordant, flip a coin to decide if the infection spreads
  if (with(el[random.edge, ], 
           infections[[t]][from] != infections[[t]][to])) {
    
    who.susceptible <- with(
      el[random.edge, ],
      c(from, to)[!c(infections[[t]][from], infections[[t]][to])]
      )
    
    infections[[t]][who.susceptible] <- sample(
      c(T, F), 
      size = 1, 
      prob = c(p.infection, 1 - p.infection)
    )
  }
}


# Now we have a list of who was infected at what time point.  Let's combine
# that into a data.frame, so we can work with it more easily
(results <- infections %>%
  lapply(FUN = as.data.frame) %>%
  lapply(FUN = set_names, value = "infected") %>%
  bind_rows(.id = "t") %>%
  mutate(id = rep(1:network.size(net), times = max.time),
         t = as.integer(t)) %>%
  tbl_df)

# This dataset is the raw results of our simulation, but it's usually easier to
# look at a summary.  Let's look at the number of people infected over time
infections.by.time <- results %>%
  group_by(t) %>%
  summarize(n.infections = sum(infected)) %>%
  mutate_each(funs(as.numeric), t, n.infections)

# Aside: in R, there are many ways to solve the same problem.  We could have
# gone directly from the raw data to the summaries using the apply functions:
# infections.by.time <- data.frame(
#   t = 1:max.time,
#   n.infected = sapply(infections, sum)
# ) 

# Plotting this relationship shows the 
qplot(data = infections.by.time, x = t, y = n.infections, geom = "line")

# Or, alternatively, we could look at whether people who are more central
# are infected sooner
time.to.infection <- results %>%
  group_by(id) %>%
  summarize(time.infected = min(t[infected])) %>%
  arrange(id) #%>%
  #mutate(indegc = degree(net))

#now we have a table of delayed infection times relative to the first infection
#and it is stored in time.to.infection

time.to.infection
min(time.to.infection$time.infected)
```
Now we have simulated data using B=0.5 and 100 nodes. We should note that the Duke simulation walk through 
assigns Time of infection not a delay time, thus, we have two nodes with time infection =1 since the source node is infected in the first time window and infects someone in the first time window.

So by examining the code we see that node 69 is assigned as the true source.
Then node 62 is the first infected after 1 day (1 time window).
So let's set delay times relative to node 69 (true source).

```{r}
time.to.infection$delay<-time.to.infection$time.infected
time.to.infection$delay[69]<-0 #set true source to delay=0
```



We want to randomly
select K observers from the network using a density =0.2

```{r}
k0= round(0.5 *sqrt(N),0) #5subobservers
#so we need to select more than 5 initial observers. 
#since we have a network of 100 nodes, let's choose sqrt(N)

K<-round(sqrt(N),0) #10 observers

#now pick 32 from network 
## Create test and training sets
set.seed(919) #same seed as before
library(rsample)
data_split <- initial_split(time.to.infection, prop = K/N)
othernodes <- testing(data_split)
observers <- training(data_split)

```
Now we sort observers by delay
```{r}
#now to set up the algorithm
#1 sort all observers in ascending order of delays
library(dplyr)

sorted<-observers %>% arrange(delay)

```
step 2 leave only k0 of observers...these are nearest observers
The optimal number of the nearest observers K0â is the minimal number of the nearest observers K0 needed to achieve maximal quality of the spread source localization.

```{r}
#take top k0 closest observers. This is better than the 32 observers and trying to keep track of all

subobs<-sorted[c(1:k0),]

set.seed(919) #same seed
#now pick a reference obs
ref<-subobs[sample(nrow(subobs),size=1), ]

```
Now step 3 is select one observe as reference and label its arrival time as reference. Last line of code above.

Step 4 is to compute a vector of observed delays relative to the reference's
```{r}
time.to.infection$diffdelay<-(time.to.infection$delay - ref$delay)
subobs$diffdelay<-(subobs$delay - ref$delay)
```

Now to do steps 5-7 of initialization

```{r}

v<-subobs[1,] #observer 1 
v$score<-0

#initialize max score as 0
maxscore<-0
```

Now to enter the main loop. We look at neighbors of v and create a BFS from its neighbors to each observer.
We calculate the score for each neighbor which uses the mean delay and variance of delay and observed delay.

```{r}
#in order to use neighbors function in igraph, we need to convert our edgelist 
#into an igraph 
nett<-graph_from_edgelist(as.matrix(el),directed=T)
plot.igraph(nett)

#get neighbors of v
neigh<-neighbors(nett,v$id,mode="out")
#these are the neighbors of v
neigh
```
Functions for calculating the score
```{r}

#let's make a score function for GMLA

score<-function(muvec,covv,delayvec){
  diff<-delayvec-muvec
  numerator<-(-1/2)*t(diff)%*%solve(covv)%*%(diff)
  denom<-sqrt(det(covv))
  s<-exp((-1/2)*numerator)*(1/denom)
  print(s)
}

```
we should also prep to calculate the mu vector and covar matrix
[Âµs]k = Âµ(|P(s, ok)| â |P(s, oK)|)
[Îs]k,i = Ï2|P(oK, ok) â© P(oK, oi)|

```{r}
computemu<-function(truemu, disttoobs,disttoref){
  mu<-truemu*(abs(disttoobs)-abs(disttoref))
}

```

Now let's walk through neighbor score calculations.
We look at the neighbors of our first observer - ID NODE 62.

Reference observer = ID 27


neighbors OF NODE 62 are: 19,26,44,52,69,95,100 as given by the neighbors function.

Now we want to perform a BFS rooted at each of these 7 nodes to the other k0 nodes.
We need to store the length of path from root node to the observer and 
the length of the path to the reference observer.

This will help us form our mu vector for each neighbor (1 x #k0)
So we will have n * (1 x k0) vectors from this step. 

Capt lambda (Cov) is a matrix that uses the length of the path from the reference node to other observers.
So it is a (k0-1) x (1-k0) matrix.

We should also store the true mu and true sigma^2. Since we know that beta=0.5 was used
Lambda= 1/sqrt(1-Beta) = sqrt(2) = mu/sigma. 

Let's set mu = 1. This would set sigma = 1/sqrt(2) or sigma^2 = 0.5 = beta.
```{r}
trumu<-1
sigma2<-0.5

#first remove reference observer from the subobs matrix 
library(Hmisc)
subobs2<-subobs[subobs$id%nin%ref$id,]

#now get shortest paths rooted at neighbors to each of the k0 observers
numberofneighbors<-length(neigh)

#store the shortest paths in a vector list
l<-vector(mode="list")
reff<-vector(mode="list") #shortest path to reference obs
for(i in 1:numberofneighbors){
#p[i]<-get.all.shortest.paths(ptnGoe, neigh[i], to = as.character(subobs$node))
l[i]<-shortest_paths(nett, from=neigh[i],to=V(nett)%in%subobs2$id, output="vpath")
reff[i]<-shortest_paths(nett, from=neigh[i],to=V(nett)%in%ref$id, output="vpath")
}
```
We can print this output to see that we have information on the shortest number of steps to each observer
iterating through each neighbor being the root.

We also have WHO or what NODES were used to get there.

Recall, the GMLA does not actually need that information. It just needs the length of the path
PTVA (the previous algorithm before GMLA), did use that information.

So let's run through getting the score for each neighbor in this first step.
```{r}

#neighbor 1 ID=19
###################\
distobs1<-vector()
for(i in 1:length(subobs2$id)){
distobs1[i]<-length(l[[1]][[i]])
}
distobs1

#these are the distances to the other 4 observers

#we also need the distance from the neighbor to the reference node
length(unlist(reff[[1]]))

#4 hops to the reference.
mu1<-vector()
#let's compute the mu vector
for(i in 1:length(subobs2$id)){
mu1[i]<-computemu(trumu,distobs1[i],length(unlist(reff[[1]])))
}

```
We see here that neighbor 1 (node ID 19) has a mean delay time vector of [0 0 -2 0 0]. This results because
the distance to the reference is = to most of the path lengths to the observers from neighbor ID 19.

Let's repeat the process for the other neighbors!

```{r}
distobs2<-vector()
distobs3<-vector()
distobs4<-vector()
distobs5<-vector()
distobs6<-vector()
distobs7<-vector()


for(i in 1:length(subobs2$id)){
distobs2[i]<-length(l[[2]][[i]])
distobs3[i]<-length(l[[3]][[i]])
distobs4[i]<-length(l[[4]][[i]])
distobs5[i]<-length(l[[5]][[i]])
distobs6[i]<-length(l[[6]][[i]])
distobs7[i]<-length(l[[7]][[i]])
}




#these are the distances to the other 5 observers

#we also need the distance from the neighbor to the reference node

#4 hops to the reference.
mu2<-vector()
mu3<-vector()
mu4<-vector()
mu5<-vector()
mu6<-vector()
mu7<-vector()

#let's compute the mu vector
for(i in 1:length(subobs2$id)){
mu2[i]<-computemu(trumu,distobs2[i],length(unlist(reff[[2]])))
mu3[i]<-computemu(trumu,distobs3[i],length(unlist(reff[[3]])))
mu4[i]<-computemu(trumu,distobs4[i],length(unlist(reff[[4]])))
mu5[i]<-computemu(trumu,distobs5[i],length(unlist(reff[[5]])))
mu6[i]<-computemu(trumu,distobs6[i],length(unlist(reff[[6]])))
mu7[i]<-computemu(trumu,distobs7[i],length(unlist(reff[[7]])))
}

```
The last thing we need is to compute Covariance matrix!
Then use the observed delay differences for the k0.


For the covariance matrix this will actually remain constant for all steps in the
algorithm. This is because it involves only information about the reference observer
and the other observers in the network.
Recall the equation is:
[Îs]k,i = Ï2|P(o_K, o_k) â© P(o_K, o_i)|

Where o_K is the reference obs. and o_k is observer k.
o_i runs from i =1 ... K-1. 

So our matrix should be (k-1) x (k-1). 
Since we have 5 observers this leaves us with a 4 x 4 matrix.

We will compute shortest path from reference to the other observers. Notice in
the equation we need to look at the actual path between reference and observers
Find the common edges (hence the intersection notation) and then obtain the magnitude of that path:
i.e. get the length of the intersection of the paths.
```{r}
sigg<-shortest_paths(nett, from=V(nett)%in%ref$id,to=V(nett)%in%subobs2$id, output="epath")
sigg
```
The printed output gives us the shortest paths from the reference node to the other observers. 

Now we want the intersection of these paths and obtain the magnitude.

```{r}
#we know that the diagonals of the matrix are just the magnitudes of the paths outputted
#above because the diagonals are for observer k with itself from the reference observer.
for (i in 1:(k0-1)){
lengths<-length(sigg[["epath"]][[i]])
print(lengths)
}

#diagonal is 3,2,3,1.
```
Now for off diagonal we need the unique intersection of the paths.
```{r}
#we create some subgraphs based on the epath output
g1 <- graph.formula(27-+77-+42-+51)
g2 <- graph.formula(27-+26-+62)
g3 <- graph.formula(27-+5-+49-+71)
g4 <- graph.formula(27-+77)

#now let's get the intersection for each 
g5 <- graph.intersection(g1, g2, keep.all.vertices = FALSE)
g5
#0 edges in common

g6 <- graph.intersection(g1, g3, keep.all.vertices = FALSE)
g6
#0 edges in common


g7 <- graph.intersection(g1, g4, keep.all.vertices = FALSE)
g7
#1 edge in common

g8 <- graph.intersection(g2, g3, keep.all.vertices = FALSE)
g8
#0 edges in common

g9 <- graph.intersection(g2, g4, keep.all.vertices = FALSE)
g9
#0 edges in common

g10 <- graph.intersection(g3, g4, keep.all.vertices = FALSE)
g10
#0 edges in common
```
Now we can form our covariance matrix using this. As can be seen, the motivation for finding the 
intersection of these paths between observers gives us an idea if we have multicoll. present in our path
creations. This is necessary when trying to find the source - as we want to factor in any variation that could occur 
when tracking the possible BFS and delay times associated with the BFS. 

```{r}
caplam<-matrix(c(length(sigg[["epath"]][[1]]),0,0,1,
                      0,length(sigg[["epath"]][[2]]), 0,0,
                               0,0,length(sigg[["epath"]][[3]]),0,
                                          1,0,0,length(sigg[["epath"]][[4]])), ncol=(k0-1),nrow=(k0-1),byrow=T )

#Multiply the matrix by the "known" sig^2

caplam<-sigma2*caplam
```
Now we are all set up to compute the scores of the neighbors FINALLY!

```{r}
score(mu1,caplam,subobs2$diffdelay)
score(mu2,caplam,subobs2$diffdelay)
score(mu3,caplam,subobs2$diffdelay)
score(mu4,caplam,subobs2$diffdelay)
score(mu5,caplam,subobs2$diffdelay)
score(mu6,caplam,subobs2$diffdelay)
score(mu7,caplam,subobs2$diffdelay)

```
We see an immediate problem here. In computing the score all scores go to infinity!
This is because of the exponential term.

So the algorithm breaks here. We have no way of knowing which neighbor to move to!

So let's take the log of this MVN score function since the exponential term seems to break the score calculation.

```{r}
logscore<-function(muvec,covv,delayvec){
  diff<-delayvec-muvec
  numerator<-(-1/2)*t(diff)%*%solve(covv)%*%(diff)
  denom<-sqrt(det(covv))
  s<-((-1/2)*numerator)-log(denom)
  print(s)
}
```
Now recalculate.
```{r}
scores1<-c(logscore(mu1,caplam,subobs2$diffdelay),
logscore(mu2,caplam,subobs2$diffdelay),
logscore(mu3,caplam,subobs2$diffdelay),
logscore(mu4,caplam,subobs2$diffdelay),
logscore(mu5,caplam,subobs2$diffdelay),
logscore(mu6,caplam,subobs2$diffdelay),
logscore(mu7,caplam,subobs2$diffdelay))


max(scores1)
```
This output shows that we should move to the 4th neighbor! So node 52.

Now we repeat the process for node 52.

```{r}
scorematrix<-matrix(ncol=2)
scorematrix<-as.matrix(cbind(neigh[4],scores1[4]))
#store the score in score matrix

neigh2<-neighbors(nett,V(nett)%in%neigh[4],mode="out")
#6 neighbors: 19,23,30,45,62,70

#now get shortest paths rooted at neighbors to each of the k0 observers
numberofneighbors2<-length(neigh2)

#store the shortest paths in a vector list
l2<-vector(mode="list")
reff2<-vector(mode="list") #shortest path to reference obs
for(i in 1:numberofneighbors2){
#p[i]<-get.all.shortest.paths(ptnGoe, neigh[i], to = as.character(subobs$node))
l2[i]<-shortest_paths(nett, from=neigh2[i],to=V(nett)%in%subobs2$id, output="vpath")
reff2[i]<-shortest_paths(nett, from=neigh2[i],to=V(nett)%in%ref$id, output="vpath")
}
```
So, we have effectively repeated the same process as before.

```{r}
distobs1<-vector()
distobs2<-vector()
distobs3<-vector()
distobs4<-vector()
distobs5<-vector()
distobs6<-vector()


for(i in 1:length(subobs2$id)){
distobs1[i]<-length(l2[[1]][[i]])
distobs2[i]<-length(l2[[2]][[i]])
distobs3[i]<-length(l2[[3]][[i]])
distobs4[i]<-length(l2[[4]][[i]])
distobs5[i]<-length(l2[[5]][[i]])
distobs6[i]<-length(l2[[6]][[i]])
}




#these are the distances to the other 5 observers

#we also need the distance from the neighbor to the reference node

#4 hops to the reference.
mu1<-vector()
mu2<-vector()

#let's compute the mu vector

We do not repeat calculating the Cov matrix because it uses the same intersection paths.

Let's proceed by using the log score as before.

```{r}
scores2<-c(logscore(mu1,caplam,subobs2$diffdelay),
logscore(mu2,caplam,subobs2$diffdelay),
logscore(mu3,caplam,subobs2$diffdelay),
logscore(mu4,caplam,subobs2$diffdelay),
logscore(mu5,caplam,subobs2$diffdelay),
logscore(mu6,caplam,subobs2$diffdelay))


max(scores2)

```
Based on this we moe to the 6th neighbor of node 52.

Let's store that node in the score matrix.

```{r}
scorematrix2<-cbind(neigh2[6],max(scores2))
scorematrix<-rbind(scorematrix,scorematrix2)

rm(scorematrix2)
```

Now we repeat the process for node 70.

```{r}

neigh3<-neighbors(nett,V(nett)%in%neigh2[6],mode="out")
#6 neighbors: 19,23,30,45,62,70

#now get shortest paths rooted at neighbors to each of the k0 observers
numberofneighbors2<-length(neigh3)

#store the shortest paths in a vector list
l2<-vector(mode="list")
reff2<-vector(mode="list") #shortest path to reference obs
for(i in 1:numberofneighbors2){
#p[i]<-get.all.shortest.paths(ptnGoe, neigh[i], to = as.character(subobs$node))
l2[i]<-shortest_paths(nett, from=neigh3[i],to=V(nett)%in%subobs2$id, output="vpath")
reff2[i]<-shortest_paths(nett, from=neigh3[i],to=V(nett)%in%ref$id, output="vpath")
}
```
So, we have effectively repeated the same process as before.

```{r}

max(scores3)

scorematrix3<-cbind(neigh3[2],max(scores3))

```{r}

```
Interesting! We have our first tie!
Neighbors 3 and 5 have the same max score!

```{r}
neigh4[3]
neigh4[5]

degree(nett,V(nett)%in%neigh4[3],mode="out")
degree(nett,V(nett)%in%neigh4[5], mode="out")
```
Because of the tie that resulted, we look at the out-degree of the nodes (i.e. how many other people could they have possibly infected)

This points to us using Neighbor 5 - Node 63.
```{r}
scorematrix4<-cbind(neigh4[5],max(scores4))

rm(scorematrix4)

We do not repeat calculating the Cov matrix because it uses the same intersection paths.

Let's proceed by using the log score as before.

```{r}

logscore(mu8,caplam,subobs2$diffdelay)
)


max(scores6)
neigh6
```
We have another tie!
Between nodes 34 and 63.
Node 63 has been selected before and 
If we examine the score matrix we see that we are caught in a loop of picking the 
same nodes and they have the same score = 28427.14.

However, further inspection of the neighbors we have ended up with we see that the true
source has been listed as a neighbor of some of these nodes, but was not moved to as having the highest score.
Nodes 63 and 64 are close to 69, but not the true source.

```{r}
neigh
neigh2
neigh3
neigh4
neigh5
neigh6

```
We see that in the first iteration we had the option to hit the true source, but did not!
Then we returned to possibly hitting the true source - node 69, in step 4, but didn't again.
