# SOURCE_IDENTIFICATION_EPIDEMICS
In conjunction with a class project, I sought to provide code for different source identification methods/algorithms such as Rumor Centrality, GMLA, and SIAS. These algorithms all operate under different assumptions, but all depend on simulating data if not using retrospective data. In the case of simulating, I provide code for propagating epidemic spread as well.

If you use my code in any capacity, please correct cite me and my colleagues whom also worked on developing this code: Kate Sanborn, Matthew Shisler, and Richard Watson.
